# Training Toolbox for PyTorch*

Training Toolbox for PyTorch\* provides a convenient environment to train
Deep Learning models and convert them using [OpenVINO™
Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for optimized
inference.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu\* 16.04 / 18.04
- Python\* 3.6+
- [libturbojpeg](https://github.com/ajkxyz/jpeg4py)
- For Python prerequisites, refer to `requirements.txt`
- *(Optional)* [OpenVINO™ R3](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)
  to export trained models


### Models

After installation, you are ready to train your own models, evaluate and use
them for prediction.
